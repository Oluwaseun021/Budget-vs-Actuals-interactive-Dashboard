## Budget-vs-Actuals-interactive-Dashboard
This project features an interactive Excel dashboard that compares budgeted vs actual financial performance for the year 2024.

## What This Dashboard Does
This dashboard compares budgeted vs actual financial performance for the period January to December 2024, allowing users to evaluate performance gaps across key financial metrics.

## Key Features
- Dynamic drop-down selector (via Data Validation) to filter performance by each month.
- A clean tabular layout that highlights variances ($ and %) between budgeted and actual values.
- Donut charts visually represent performance "miss" or "hit" for:
* Revenue
* Gross Profit
* Total Operating Expenses (OPEX)
* Net Income
Each donut chart clearly indicates how far actuals deviated from the budget making it easy to spot underperformance (miss) or overspending (hit) at a glance.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Excel Formulas & Conditional Formatting
- Data Validation (for month selection)
- Donut charts for KPI visuals

 ## Why I Built This
I created this dashboard to visualize budget vs actual performance using Excel. It shows where targets were met or missed, using an interactive layout and donut charts. This project combines financial analysis with clear, visual reporting.
